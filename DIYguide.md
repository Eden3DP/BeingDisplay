# FAQ
Q: What is the BeingDisplay?
---
A: BeingDisplay is a 3D printed case, holding a single-board computer with an attached hologram-like 3D display.

Q: What does the BeingDisplay do?
---
A: This hologram-like device is running a full bitcoin & lightning node with displaying, as a hologram, any images videos and CAD files that you are preparing to 3D print. This device is designed to be a hologram display personal server accompanied with your 3D printer.

Q: What is the purpose of the BeingDisplay?
---
A: The main purpose of this device is to act as a personal server, accompaning your 3D printer which features a 3D hologram-like display, showing you a "print preview" mode, in full 3D-like display before you begin to 3D print said object. This also acts as a full bitcoin & lightning node to connect to. 

[In future release versions, this microSD card will become more useful with on-device features, without having to remove the hard drive.]

Q: How stupid. Why would I want a bitcoin node with a display next to my 3D printer!?
---
A: Why wouldn't you want to see what you are about to print, before you print it, IN 3D HOLOGRAM-LIKE FORM? This was designed by us, for us. We are simply sharing it with the world and excited to recieve any feedback to make the proper improvments where necessary in upcoming versions.  Thank you for any constructive criticism and feedback. It's greatly appreciated.
